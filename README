Thanks to Chris Jensen for the windows compatability and to Pat Szuta for
the DateTime and Base64 objects.


INSTALLATION
------------

See the INSTALL file which should be included with this distribution.


INFO
----

This is version 0.8.8.2 of the xmlrpc library.  There have been some big
changes since earlier versions.  Please see the CHANGELOG for version
information.

xmlrpc.py is pretty well documented.  If you want more documentation, at
this point you'll have to go to the source.  Some time I should document
everything better, especially the nonblocking aspects of the server and
client.


FEATURES
--------

* Efficiency:  This library seems to be 20x-100x faster than other xmlrpc
libraries I've tried.  I have benchmarked this library at about 1000 RPC
calls per second between two different celeron 466 machines.  Both speed
and memory use seem to be exponentially better (related to the size of
objects being sent across) than the existing Python libraries.

* Non-Blocking IO:  This becomes important when you have critical
applications (especially servers) that CANNOT be held up because a client
is trickling a request in or is reading a response at 1 byte per second.

* Event based:  This goes hand in hand with non-blocking IO.  It lets you
use an event based model for your client/server application, where the
main body is basically the select loop on the file descriptors you are
interested in.  The work is done by registering callbacks for different
events you received on file descriptors.  This can be very nice.  There is
some work to be done here, but all the hooks are in place.  See TO DO for
a list of the features that have yet to be incorporated.

* Portable: Source should be compatible on both windows and POSIX
