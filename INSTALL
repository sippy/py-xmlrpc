==================================
Installation of the Xmlrpc library
==================================


Using RPM's (Redhat Linux)
==========================
Several different rpms (both binaries and source) are available at
"http://www.sourcelight.com/xmlrpc".

All you need to do is run (as root):

rpm -i xmlrpc-0.9.....rpm	(substitute the real name of your rpm)


Using .exe files (windows)
==========================
run the self installing executable available at
"http://www.sourcelight.com/xmlrpc".



Using Binaries
===============
Several different binaries are available for _xmlrpcmodule.so on different
platforms at "http://www.sourcelight.com/xmlrpc".

All you need to do is (on a Posix system):

tar -xzvf xmlrpc-0.9.tar.gz
cd xmlrpc-0.9
(become root)
cp -p xmlrpc.py _xmlrpcmodule.so /usr/lib/python1.5/site-packages/

Of course, you should replace xmlrpc-0.8 with the applicable version and alter
the path to your site-packes file as necessary.



Using Source
===============

POSIX and Python 1.6/2.0 (or 1.5.2 w/ distutils):
----------------------------------------------
	To build xmlrpc for Python 1.6/2.0, all you need is the distutils 
package, which comes with these versions of python, and gcc.  If you want to
build it this way for Python 1.5.2, all you need to do is grab the distutils
package from:

http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/download.html

To build, use the following commands:

tar -xzvf xmlrpc-0.9.tar.gz
cd xmlrpc-0.9
python setup.py build


This creates a "build" sub-directory.  In it, you will find a directory called
"lib-<your system>".  Inside that directory, you will find _xmlrpc.so and
xmlrpc.py.  Copy these to where you need to use them or, to install system
wide:

(become root)
python setup.py install


Windows and Python 1.6/2.0 (or 1.5.2 w/ distutils):
------------------------------------------------
	In order to build xmlrpc for windows, you must have a version of
Visual C++ installed (v 5.0+).  You also must get the distutils package for
Python 1.5.2 if that is what your are building it for.  Once you satisfy these
requirements, you may build xmlrpc.


To build, unzip that archive to a directory somewhere.  Open up a "cmd" window
and run the following command after chaging to the directory you unzipped to:

python setup.py build

This creates a "build" sub-directory.  In it, you will find a directory called
"lib-win32.2.0".  Inside that directory, you will find _xmlrpc.so and
xmlrpc.py.  Copy these to where you need to use them or, to install system
wide:

python setup.py install


Compiling by Hand
-----------------
tar -xzvf xmlrpc-0.9.tar.gz
cd xmlrpc-0.9
** edit the Makefile to reflect your version of python (PYTHON) **
make clean; make
(become root)
make install
